# My Experiments With Competitive Programming

## Why
I'm about to start the sixth sem of graduation, yet I haven't started competitive programming, data structures, algorithms. I'm creating this repo/blog to get regular at cp(thus hopefully improving my ratings). I will be experimenting with this domain for the upcoming 10-12 months. So let's see how this experiment goes :crossed_fingers:
